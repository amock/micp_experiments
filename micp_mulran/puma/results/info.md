- 0: stamp
- 1-16: T flattened. Transform base to map. To recover 4x4 transform matrix call `T = data[1:17].reshape((4,4))`
- 17: npoints (error in data)
- 18: nvalidpoints (in lidar range)
- 19: ninliers. correspondences < max_dist
- 20: mean point to mesh distance over all correspondence distances < outlier_dist
- 21: median point to mesh distance over all correspondence distances < outlier_dist

## Error

17: npoints was accedently set to nvalidpoints. 65536 points are generated by the lidar all the time. TODO: fix in data
